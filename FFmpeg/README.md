# Hello There!

This is a stadnard ArOZ Online Beta Module that is ready to be loaded into your ArOZ Online System.

To install this module to your system with AOB (or above) installed, simply download this repo as zip and remove the 
"License" and "README" from the zip, upload it to your system via "Add or Remove WebApp" and you are done :)

This module is mainly design for module developers of other ArOZ Online Modules. Contact me directly if you have further 
questions or you have no idea what the hell is this thing.
